I recently obtained my Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Computer Science (with High Honors) with a minor in Environmental Studies from [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/), graduating Cum Laude.

At Dartmouth, I conducted research through a joint effort between the [Jacobson Laboratory](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/jacobsonlab/) at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine and the [HealthX Lab](https://healthx-dartmouth.org/) in Dartmouth Computer Science. I was fortunate to be advised by Professors [Nicholas Jacobson](https://www.nicholasjacobson.com/) and [Andrew Campbell](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~campbell/), and mentored by [Arvind Pillai](https://arvind1609.github.io/). 

Moving forward, Iâ€™m especially excited about using social computing and machine learning to study real-world behavioral patterns, including applications in **youth mental health**, **digital well-being**, and **community-centered mental health support**.

At Dartmouth, my research was generously supported by multiple fundings, including the [Dartmouth Neukom Institute for Computational Science](https://neukom.dartmouth.edu/funding/students/neukom-scholars-program) and the [James O. Freedman Presidential Scholarship](https://students.dartmouth.edu/ugar/research/programs/presidential-scholars). I have also completed a rigorous curriculum, including eight graduate-level CS courses, and earned five academic citations for excellence in CS coursework.

Outside of academics, I enjoy crocheting, running, skiing, and scuba diving, and I have been playing the cello for 13 years.

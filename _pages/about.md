I recently obtained my Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Computer Science (High Honors) with a minor in Environmental Studies from [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/), graduating Cum Laude.

At Dartmouth, I conducted research through a joint effort between the [Jacobson Laboratory](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/jacobsonlab/) at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine and the [HealthX Lab](https://healthx-dartmouth.org/) in Dartmouth Computer Science. I was fortunate to be advised by Professors [Nicholas Jacobson](https://www.nicholasjacobson.com/) and [Andrew Campbell](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~campbell/), and mentored by [Arvind Pillai](https://arvind1609.github.io/). My recent work focused on analyzing wearable sensor data (such as physical activity from smartwatches) and building foundation models to extract health and behavioral insights. 

Iâ€™m broadly interested in the intersection of computational social science, natural language processing, and mental health, with the goal of using computational methods to better understand and improve well-being. Key research directions include:

  - **Foundation models** for time-series wearable sensor data
  - **Multimodal integration** with **LLMs** for healthcare/mental health applications

Previously, I worked as a research assistant with Professor [SouYoung Jin](http://souyoungjin.com/) on video understanding, and with Professor [Alberto Quattrini Li](https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/albertoq/), where I contributed to a multimodal perception dataset for autonomous surface vehicles.

At Dartmouth, my research has been generously supported by multiple fundings, including the [Dartmouth Neukom Institute for Computational Science](https://neukom.dartmouth.edu/funding/students/neukom-scholars-program) and the [James O. Freedman Presidential Scholarship](https://students.dartmouth.edu/ugar/research/programs/presidential-scholars). I have also completed a rigorous curriculum, including eight graduate-level CS courses, and earned five academic citations for excellence in CS coursework.

Outside of academics, I enjoy crocheting, running, skiing, and scuba diving, and I have been playing the cello for 13 years.

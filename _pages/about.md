I am a senior undergraduate student ('25) at [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/) majoring in Computer Science.

I currently conduct research at the [Jacobson Laboratory](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/jacobsonlab/) at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, advised by Prof. [Nicholas Jacobson](https://www.nicholasjacobson.com/), where I focus on developing models, techniques, and applications for mental health research. My recent work, in collaboration with Prof. [SouYoung Jin](https://souyoungjin.github.io/), explores wearable actigraphy data and foundation models for behavioral insights. I'm broadly interested in the intersection of computational social science, natural language processing, and mental health, which explores innovative ways to leverage AI for understanding and improving mental well-being. Key focus areas include:

  - **Foundation models** for time-series wearable sensor data
  - **Multimodal integration** with **LLMs** for healthcare/mental health applications
  - **Synthetic data generation** for model generalization and downstream tasks
  - Leveraging **social media data** for behavioral interventions and precision health

I have also conducted research at the [Dartmouth Reality and Robotics Lab (RLab)](https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/home/) advised by Prof. [Alberto Quattrini Li](https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/albertoq/), where I contributed to advancing autonomous navigation for marine robotics and collaborating on a project for a multi-modal perception dataset for autonomous surface vehicles.

At Dartmouth, my research has been generously supported by multiple fundings, including the [Dartmouth Neukom Institute for Computational Science](https://neukom.dartmouth.edu/funding/students/neukom-scholars-program) and the [James O. Freedman Presidential Scholarship](https://students.dartmouth.edu/ugar/research/programs/presidential-scholars). I have also completed a rigorous curriculum, including seven graduate-level CS courses, and earned five academic citations for excellence in CS coursework.

Outside of academics, I enjoy crocheting, running, skiing, and scuba diving, and I have been playing the cello for 13 years.

abstract: 'Wearable movement data is collected by nearly all commercially available smartwatches and is a valuable resource for mental health research, as the data can reflect fine-grained temporal behavioral trends. Despite its promise, the development of foundation models for health wearable modeling remains limited when compared to clinical image and text analysis. As such, we designed  transformers with patch embeddings and used self-supervised masked autoencoder pretraining on minute-level week-long actigraphy (physical activity intensity measurement) sequences to develop and investigate the Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT), the first open-source foundation model specifically designed for wearable movement time series. Pretrained on data from 21,538  U.S. participants in a nationally representative health cohort from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), PAT consistently outperformed prior models across key mental health prediction tasksâ€”including benzodiazepine and SSRI use, depression, and sleep disorders. During the benzodiazepine medication usage prediction task, PAT demonstrated the largest improvement over non-foundational deep learning models commonly used for time-series modeling (i.e., 55.6% improvement over the LSTM, 21.4% improvement over the 1-D CNN, 14.8% improvement over the ConvLSTM). Beyond predictive accuracy, PAT provides interpretable attention maps highlighting specific periods of daily activity most important for its clinical outcomes prediction, which may offer increased model transparency as well as potential clinical insights. The results suggest that PAT offers a lightweight, adaptable and scalable solution to advance clinical insight from wearable sensor data for researchers and clinicians.
